# AI Recommender system for anime series

### About project

The recommender system leverages Matrix Factorization (MF), a machine learning technique for modeling relationships in high-dimensional data. Commonly used in recommendation systems and collaborative filtering, MF decomposes a matrix into lower-dimensional matrices whose product approximates the original. This method excels at handling sparse data, such as user-item interactions.

### Usage
Data files are too big to upload on Github. In order to use model:
1. Download both data sets from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/CooperUnion/anime-recommendations-database
2. Create a directory named 'data' in the repo folder
3. Extract rating dataset and place it in data along with the anime dataset
4. Done :3
